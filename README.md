# Arbitrary-Precision Floating-Point Library

ARPFloat is an implementation of arbitrary precision 
[floating point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754) data
structures and utilities. The library can be used to emulate floating point
operation, in software, or create new floating point data types.
`no_std` environments are supported by disabling the `std` feature.

### Example

```rust
  use arpfloat::Float;
  use arpfloat::new_float_type;

  // Create a new type: 15 bits exponent, 112 significand.
  type FP128 = new_float_type!(15, 112);

  // Use Newton-Raphson to find the square root of 5.
  let n = FP128::from_u64(5);

  let two = FP128::from_u64(2);
  let mut x = n;

  for _ in 0..1000 {
      x = (x + (n / x))/two;
  }

  println!("fp128: {}", x);
  println!("fp64:  {}", x.as_f64());
```

The program above will print this output:
```
fp128: 2.2360679774997896964091736687312763
fp64:  2.23606797749979
```

The library also provides API that exposes rounding modes, and low-level
operations.

```rust
    // Explicit control over rounding modes:
    let val = FP128::mul_with_rm(y, z, RoundingMode::NearestTiesToEven);

    // View the internals of the float:
    let fp = FP16::from_i64(15);
    let m = fp.get_mantissa();

    // Prints FP[+ E=+3 M=11110000000]
    fp.dump();
```


Control the rounding-mode for type conversion:
```rust
   use arpfloat::{FP16, FP32, RoundingMode};
   let x = FP32::from_u64(2649);

   // Convert from FP64 to FP16.
   let b : FP16 = x.cast_with_rm(RoundingMode::Zero);
   println!("{}", b); // Prints 2648!
```

The [examples](examples) directory contains a program that computes many digits of pi in float-256.
